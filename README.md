This is a web application where you select the date of your birth and gender. Once you submit, the application uses a  formula to get the actual day you were born i.e Day of the week (d) = ( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7 ; where CC is the century digits, YY is the year digits, MM is the month and DD is the day of the month. Based on the day from the calculation above it checks your gender and assigns you an Akan name from the Ghanaian naming system.
